# Exercise 7

In this exercise, you will practice grouping by value.

1.- Open Top500SongsGrouped.xml and review the code. You will see that it contains a list of Song elements. We've seen this document before.

2.- Open GroupSongs.xsl for editing.

3.- Write code that outputs the songs by artist. For each artist, the output should appear something like this:
```
<h2>28. Animals - 4 Song(s)</h2>
<ol>
<li>House Of The Rising Sun</li>
<li>We Gotta Get Out Of This Place</li>
<li>Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood</li>
<li>It's My Life</li>
</ol>
```

4.- where 28 is the position of the artist (i.e., there are 27 artists that appear before the Animals, Animals is the name of the artist, and 4 is the number of songs the artist has in the top 500.
