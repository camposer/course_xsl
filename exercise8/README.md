# Exercise 8

In this exercise, you will make an XSLT more efficient by using keys.

1.- Open Top500SongsKey.xml and review the code. You will see that it contains a list of Song elements. Part of the code is shown below these instructions.

2.- Transform Top500SongsKey.xml against SongsByArtist.xsl. You will see that, for each song, it outputs the number of songs that artist has in the top 500. Currently, this is done without using keys.

3.- Open SongsByArtist.xsl for editing.

4.- Modify the code so that it uses keys to do the same thing as it currently does. 

5.- To test your solution, transform Top500SongsKey.xml against SongsByArtist.xsl.
