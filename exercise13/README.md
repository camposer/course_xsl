# Exercise 13

In this exercise, you will use what we have covered so far to create a multi-page FO document from an XML document.

1.- Open WinnieThePooh.xml and examine its structure.

2.- Open WinnieThePooh.xsl for editing.

3.- Modify the document so that it produces a document like WinnieThePooh.pdf.

4.- To test your solution, transform WinnieThePooh.xml against FoBasics/Exercises/WinnieThePooh.xsl.
